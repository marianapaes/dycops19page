many applications, including pharmaceutical separations, nuclear waste disposal, and
optoelectronic metamaterials. Due to improvements in sensing technology, it is now becoming
possible to monitor the crystalline state in real time during the crystallization process, and this
sensor technology opens up new possibilities for feedback control. Here we monitor the crystalline
state and use this data to build an empirical Markov state model. An optimal feedback policy is
then calculated using the empirical model along with dynamic programming. Alternatively, the
empirical model can be calculated from simulation "data" coming from a detailed many-body
simulation. Experimental results demonstrating the method will be presented for molecular
crystallization and colloidal crystallization. </p>

            <p>Uncertainties and perturbations are common phenomena when trying to control and/or observe a
nonlinear process, and achieving the control objective under these circumstances is an important
and challenging task. A strategy to deal with uncertainties/perturbations is the use of switching. In
particular, the (Higher Order) Sliding Mode (HOSM) Control and Observation algorithms have
shown their ability to successfully deal with these problems. In this talk we will first overview a
Lyapunov-based approach to design HOSM controllers and observers developed recently in our
group, which allows a systematic study of their convergence and performance properties. Then we
show that a discontinuous version of the classical and very successful PI controller can be
developed, that has very strong robustness properties. Finally, we illustrate the possibility of using
discontinuous observers to estimate the variables of non observable systems. We illustrate this
using a simple bioreactor and an electromechanical system.</p>

Engineering (Automatic Control) from the Helmut Schmidt Universit&auml;t, Hamburg, Germany in 1995.
The Diploma-Degree in Electrical Engineering (Automatic Control) from the Universit&auml;t zu
Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany in 1990, and the Licentiate-Degree (with honors) in Electronic

he is researcher at the Institute of Engineering at the National University of Mexico (UNAM), in
Mexico City. He is full Professor of Automatic Control and the Head of the Electrical and
Computing Department at the Institute of Engineering of UNAM. He is Investigador Titular C and
PRIDE D (the highest possible level at the UNAM) and Investigador Nacional Nivel III in the SNI,
the highest level in the Mexican system. He has served as the chair of the Technical Committee
(TC8.4) for Biosystems and Bioprocesses of the International Federation of Automatic Control

PhD and 33 M.Sc. theses. His current research interests include robust and non-linear control, in
particular, with emphasis on Lyapunov methods to higher order sliding modes control with
applications to biochemical (wastewater treatment processes) and electromechanical processes,
and the design of nonlinear observers.

<p><b class="mediumGreen">Plenary talk: </b><b>The autonomous industrial plant - Future of process engineering, Operations
and maintenance </b></p><p>Today media report almost daily about new advances in self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.
For autonomous driving there are already established standards with levels from 0 to 5 describing
the steps from complete manual operation to fully autonomous driving. While many people - and
of course in particular the automotive industry - believe fully self-driving cars are feasible in the
near future one may ask how applicable this is in our domain? Is it realistic to aim towards a fully
autonomous chemical plant? What do we even mean by an autonomous plant?</p><p>
This talk will make an effort in defining levels of autonomy for a process industry. However, when
the automotive standard focuses completely on operation of the car, it is for process and
manufacturing industry equally important to take steps towards also autonomous engineering and
autonomous maintenance. We will illustrate steps towards higher levels of autonomy by recent
examples from different industrial applications.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;" ><b>Biography:</b>Dr. Alf Isaksson received an MSc in Computer Engineering and a PhD in Automatic
Control, in 1983 and 1988 respectively, both from Link&ouml;ping University, Sweden. After graduating
he stayed at Link&ouml;ping University until 1991 as an Assistant Professor. From 1991 to 1992 he
spent one year as a Research Associate at The University of Newcastle, Australia. Returning to
Sweden in 1992 Isaksson moved to the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, where
eventually in 1999 he was promoted to full Professor. During this time he also spent 6 months in
1999 at the Pulp &amp; Paper Centre of University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada as visiting
professor.
In 2001 he made the shift from academic to industrial research and joined ABB Corporate
Research in V&auml;ster&aring;s, Sweden. After a specialist career culminating in an appointment to
Corporate Research Fellow in 2009, he is now since January 2014 Group Research Area Manager
with the responsibility of internally coordinating all research in Control at all of ABB's 7 research
centers world-wide. At the same time Isaksson still kept a connection to the academic world as
Adjunct Professor in Automatic Control at Link&ouml;ping University 2006-2015, where he was leading a
Process Industry Center from 2009 to 2012.</p>
